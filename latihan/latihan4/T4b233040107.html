            <p>Wagyu beef—you know, the transcendently tender, fatty, umami-rich steak—has become as synonymous with
                luxury as caviar or black truffles. But no matter how many Michelin-starred menus this delicacy graces,
                all of the facts about Wagyu steak still tend to elude even the most seasoned diners.</p>
            <p>“It’s an extremely fascinating but confusing world,” says Joe Heitzeberg, the co-founder and CEO of Crowd
                Cow. Heitzeberg, who admits it wasn’t until he’d spent ample time meeting with Japanese slaughterhouse
                owners and farmers (his minor in Japanese at the University of Washington helped) that he felt like he
                truly understood Wagyu.</p>
            <p>“There’s a lot of information out there that’s not accurate, mostly unintentionally, and perhaps some
                intentionally,” he says. Because of the prestige associated with Wagyu and the premium price it fetches
                (a pound can easily run in the triple-digits), some people throw around “Wagyu” and related terms as a
                marketing gimmick, even if what the purveyor is selling isn’t that luxury version. So what is Wagyu
                beef—and why does it taste and feel unlike any other steak you’ve ever had? We’ve gathered some of the
                foremost experts in restaurant industry to explain.</p>

            <div class="hero2"></div>
            <div class="content">

                <h4>What is Wagyu Beef?</h4> <br>
                <p>Simply put, Wagyu means Japanese cow, But the straightforward definition belies a subject riddled
                    with
                    misinformation.For starters, it’s pronounced wah-gyoo, not wah-goo, a mispronunciation that’s common
                    even among American
                    Wagyu farms (and that admittedly tripped up even this intrepid reporter), says Heitzeberg.</p>
                <p>And Wagyu isn’t an umbrella term for just any Japanese cow. The luxury version of Wagyu we all want
                    on
                    our plates refers to a specific breed of Japanese cattle with special genetic qualities. “There are
                    four
                    breeds native to Japan. Of those four breeds, one of the breeds is genetically unique,” Heitzeberg
                    says.
                    “It has a genetic predisposition to create this crazy marbling of fat on inside of muscle tissue. No
                    other livestock does that.” Think of your average piece of steak. Chances are, it’ll have a fat cap
                    on
                    its outside. With Wagyu, the cow metabolizes the fat internally, so it’s integrated within the
                    muscle.

            <h4>What’s the difference between Japanese and American Wagyu?</h4> <br>
            <p>In addition to the looser rating system and divergent cattle-farming techniques, the biggest difference
                between American Wagyu and Japanese Wagyu is that Japanese Wagyu is purebred, where American Wagyu is
                crossbred. “[American Wagyu] is still going to be crazy marbled with intense flavor, but it’s most
                likely
                Wagyu bred with angus,” Henderson says.

                “Almost all of that stuff is angus beef crossbred with Wagyu in an uncontrolled, unregulated,
                unspecified
                percentage of DNA,” Heitzeberg says. “I’ve eaten my bodyweight several times over in Japanese Wagyu and
                American Wagyu, and I haven’t tasted anything that’s angus mixed with Wagyu at any percentage that
                tastes
                like Japanese Wagyu does at 100 percent.”

                Because of this, American Wagyu doesn’t have the sweet umami flavor that Japanese Wagyu does, and it
                never
                quite reaches that same melt-in-your-mouth level of marbling. Though Heitzeberg is quick to stipulate
                that
                this doesn’t mean that American Wagyu isn’t delicious.</p>
